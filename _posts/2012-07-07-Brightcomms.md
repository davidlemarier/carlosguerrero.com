[Brightcomms](http://www.brightcomms.com/) is a Telecom Contractor that offers their 2G/3G/LTE specialized services all over America.

They have found that offering their own in-house software solutions, is a better way to keep clients satisfied and gives the company an advantage in adaptation to new technologies. 

With native (PyQT) and web (Django) interfaces, clients can see and filter the data they really need to know, and the rapid access to determinant pieces of information (KPIs) is usefull to other departments of the company, that take care of the performance of client's networks. 

[Taking charge of the IT and Development department](http://www.carlosguerrero.com/articles/IT/) of the company was a very challenging and interesting task to do, the learning was inmense.
