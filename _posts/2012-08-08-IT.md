After starting remotelly with a Django App that was able to get into privative Sybase databases and take all the important 2G/3G/LTE information, replicate it on Postgres and then create online/email reports and interactive graphs (KPIs) plus allowing RF specialists and Engineers to manage their own SQL queries, the company CEO at [Brightcomms](http://brightcomms.com/) asigned me to be in charge of all the IT needs of the company, and travel to the different sites that required attention.

The IT operation required all kinds of activities, ranging from the usual Local Network Setup, to the implementation of OpenVPN connection between Asterisk servers to allow internal VoIP communication at no aditional cost. Taking advantage of this, [SipDroid VoIP App was customized](https://github.com/guerrerocarlos/Custom-Sipdroid) to enable easy instalation and use for all company executives and engineers with no setup required at all in their phones. 

Another remarkable implementation, was the use of Torrents to allow unprecedented network speeds in the transfer of big chunks of information (>5GB/each), resulting for activities (drive-tests) performed by the company in different location but all analyzed and processed in one facility every day, activity that was previously performed using FTP. Torrents allowed a >50% improvement.
