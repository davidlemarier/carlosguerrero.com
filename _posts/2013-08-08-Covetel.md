[OpenERP](http://openerp.com) is based on a project called [OpenObject](https://launchpad.net/openobject) that allows web applications design focusing on modeling, no major concerns about database structure (thanks to its embeded ORM) and minimum requirements in the design of the GUI. The focus becomes the key business and optimizing resources through this tool.

The result is ready for production applications at a fraction of the usual time, with dozens of official modules ready to be installed, OpenERP presents itself as the ideal tool for government solutions.

The adaptations required and support is provided by [Covetel](http://www.covetel.com.ve/) as leader in Venezuela for consulting services and free software development, always accompanied by training and technology transference.
