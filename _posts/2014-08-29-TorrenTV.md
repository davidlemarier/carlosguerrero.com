The following week, the first beta version was released.

Debuting in internet through a [post in Medium](https://medium.com/@torrentv_app/popcorn-time-for-your-tv-dccda0dffc53), the reasons for its development where explained and the product available for download for free from <http://torrentv.github.io/>, with later option to send a beer or a coffee to it's developer (a.k.a: Me).

After the first traffic peak (20.000/day), it went down again staying in a 1000-2000 sessions per day basis, and still descending, going back to a more organic growth.

## Future

Since TorrenTV is open source, anyone can learn from how it works, adapt it and contribute to it. Probably there is going to be some UI improvements, any contribution is welcome, the best way to make them is by [Github](http://github.com/torrentv/) Pull Requests.

The most [requested feature that is still pending is ***Subtitles***](https://github.com/TorrenTV/TorrenTV/issues/14), but because of Airplay limitations adding them would require fusing them the movie before streaming it, wich would at the same time add compatibility for more movie formats (another much requested feature) and including ***ffmpeg*** inside TorrenTV (node-webkit) hasn't yet been done. So will be matter of wait and see, more investigation and learning is to be done :) the journey continues.
