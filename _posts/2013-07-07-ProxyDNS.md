**[ProxyDNS](http://proxydns.co/)**, is a DNS service that removes geographically based blocks from services like [Pandora](http://pandora.com/), [Spotify](http://spotify.com/), [Hulu+](http://hulu.com/), [Netflix](http://netflix.com/), etc.

It's a proxy that doesn't require you to install any software, but just configure the DNS settings on your devices or directly in your router. So it can be used for unblocking devices like:  XBOX360, AppleTV, Roku, Sony Bravia, WDTV.

Only blocked services use the proxy, so the rest of the traffic remains unaltered and speeds are much better than using a VPN also there are no aditional privacy concerns.
